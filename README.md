# Semente

Semente is a toolkit in the making to co-create community-based digital policy. Its current prototype results from a collaboration between the Instituto Neos in Brazil and the University of Bristol. Semente builds knowledge exchange in projects such as fonte.wiki and ID21. It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies.
